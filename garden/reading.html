<h1>Reading Thoughts and Notes</h1>

<p>I love to read. I sometimes take notes. I like to blather about what I've read and read what other people think about what they've read.</p>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.reading_thoughts %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
