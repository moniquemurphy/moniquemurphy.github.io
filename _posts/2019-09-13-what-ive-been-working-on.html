<p>For the past several months, I've just kept a notes file open with the title "Ideas" that I periodically dump stuff into. I'm a lot better at generating ideas than following through on them. I often quickly become bored or, more commonly, convince myself that my idea wasn't that great to begin with, so it should be abandoned before anyone else wastes their time. But I want to follow through on this: I'm keeping a blog, I'm going to talk about language learning somewhere other than in my various-levels-of-willing friends' gchat windows, and I'm going to write some tutorials for annoying but useful tech junk I've done. Join me on this wild ride if you dare.</p>

<p>To begin, let's start with a list of links that I have categorized in my bookmarks as "Stuff I Talk About All The Time." These are links I dig for because they are often relevant to what I'm thinking about or conversations I'm having, and you can probably tell a lot about me from them.</p>
