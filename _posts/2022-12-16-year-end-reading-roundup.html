<h2>Reading Roundup 2022!</h2>
<p>
    One of my (rare) New Year's resolutions is to track what I've read better. I always like the look back. Here's a sampling of stuff I read this year (not including books, which I was pretty delinquent about, but trying to be kind to myself) that wasn't included in previous reading roundups. I tried to avoid sharing things that were super topical, but I think next year I'll include them because it acts as an anchoring in time. Special thanks to Metafilter and Mastodon and friends for linking many of these.
</p>
<p>
    This year I moved across the country and am expecting a second kid in the spring, not to mention we're living in a pandemic no one wants to acknowledge anymore, so it's been A Lot. Here's hoping I can crawl out of the hole a little bit next year.

Sometimes reading is about the experience, enjoying the moments of reading a book, and not necessarily having perfect recall of whatever was in it. Sometimes you're left with a feeling. If something strikes you particularly, you can always reread. I'm trying to be more chill about the ephemerality of memory.</li>
