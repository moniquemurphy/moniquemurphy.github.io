<h2>Reading Roundup</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://freethoughtblogs.com/oceanoxia/2022/06/27/science-says-win-first-answer-questions-later/">Science says win first, ask questions later</a>. I've been yelling about this forever, but especially since the Affordable Care Act negotiations. Don't negotiate with people who whine about doing the right thing for good or bad faith reasons, just do the right thing and people will get used to it. But, as this author rightfully notes, it works the other way, and now people will start to see abortion as wrong <i>because</i> the law says it is in some states.</li>
