        Having ice cream with extra whipped cream.<br>
        And driving to the beach to play with our Donna.△<br>

        ※Repeat<br>
        <br>
        雲の上はいつだって晴れ<br>
        近すぎて見えない幸せ<br>
        目線を変えれば見えてくる<br>
        出会いあふれてるこの街<br>
        <br>
        Just remember I'm with you. (Show me your love)<br>
        Just remember always we are together.<br>

        There's nothing that's that important,<br>
        What can you catch with an empty heart?<br>
        On that Sunday afternoon when I was honest with myeslf,<br>
        I realized that you're special.<br>

        It's always sunny above the clouds,<br>
        If there's a happiness too close for you to see,<br>
        Change your point of view and look again,<br>
        This town is full of fated meetings.<br>
