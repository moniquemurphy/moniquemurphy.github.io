        Teotorriatte konomama iko<br>
        Aisuruhitoyo<br>
        Shizukanayoi ni<br>
        Hikariotomoshi<br>
        Itoshiki oshieoidaki<br>
        <br>
        When I'm gone no need to wonder<br>
        If I ever think of you<br>
        The same moon shines<br>
        The same wind blows for both of us<br>
        And time is but a paper moon<br>
        Be not gone<br>
        <br>
        Though I'm gone it's as though<br>
        I hold the flower that touches you<br>
        A new life grows<br>
        The blossom knows there's no one else<br>
        Could warm my heart as much as you<br>
        Be not gone<br>
        <br>
        ※Let us cling together as the years go by<br>
        Oh my love my love<br>
        In the quiet of the night<br>
        Let our candle always burn<br>
        Let us never lose the lessons we have learned※<br>
        <br>
        Hear my song still think of me<br>
        The way you've come to think of me<br>
        The nights grow long<br>
        But dreams live on<br>
        Just close your pretty eyes<br>
        And you can be with me<br>
        Dream on<br>
        <br>
        Teo toriatte konomama iko<br>
        Aisuruhitoyo<br>
        Shizukana yoi ni<br>
        Hikariotomoshi<br>
        Itoshiki oshieo idaki<br>
        <br>
        When I'm gone they'll say we were all fools<br>
        And we don't understand<br>
        Oh be strong don't turn your heart<br>
        We're all you're all we're all for all for always<br>

        In the quiet evening,<br>
