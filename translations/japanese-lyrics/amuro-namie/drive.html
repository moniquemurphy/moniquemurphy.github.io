        Look around, what a lovely day<br>
        There's feelin' we'll have a great day<br>
        <br>
        The sky is blue as it can ever be<br>
        Oh, how the breezy wind relaxes me<br>
        <br>
        いつも以上に　上がりだすテンションを<br>

        driving, driving (oh yeah)<br>
        楽しもう　2人のfree time<br>
        <br>
        あてもなく走ろう　このhighwayをとばして<br>
        光るこの海をこえ　たどり着くの secret zone<br>
        <br>
        いつも以上に　はしゃいじゃう私を<br>
        優しくうけとめて　もう始まってる sweet time<br>
