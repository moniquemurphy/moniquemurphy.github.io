        Can you remember that?<br>
        I remember<br>
        <br>
        信号待ち見かけた見覚えのある青いT-SHIRT (I remember that)<br>
        変わらない笑顔流れた時はちょうど3 years (Time goes by)<br>
        声かけようとその隣に見知らぬ誰か<br>
        ふと反らした目に映る空はいつもと同じで<br>
        <br>
        きっとこうして人はちょっとずつ<br>
        過ぎた季節に記憶を隠す<br>
        いつか零れた涙集まって<br>
        陽を浴びて輝くまで<br>
        <br>
        ※そうだからBaby悲しまないで<br>
        考えても分かんない時もあるって<br>
        散々でも前に続く道のどこかに<br>
        望みはあるから<br>
        雨の朝でも(Baby don't cry)<br>
        愛が消えそうでも(Baby don't cry)<br>
        一人になんてしないから(Baby don't cry)<br>
        Baby don't cry<br>
        Always stay by your side※<br>
        <br>
        眠れない夜は何度も寝返りばかり<br>
        心細くなって吐き出すため息は深い(Yeah I know)<br>
        また抱えた不安これ以上解消出来ず<br>
        誰かの手握って見えない明日へ繋ごうと努力して<br>
        <br>
        だってそうして人は何度でも<br>
        闇に立ち向かう強さあるはず<br>
        与えられて選ぶんじゃなくて<br>
        その足で 踏み出して<br>
        <br>
        ※Repeat<br>
        <br>
        鏡に映る自分が(When I lose myself)<br>
        まるで別人みたいな日もあるけど(When I need someone's help)<br>
        諦めないでLet me see your smile<br>
        ねえ 良くなる方に捉えたら?<br>
        いつか笑って話せる日がくるから(Don't cry, cry)<br>
        <br>
        さあだからBabyその手伸ばして<br>
        雲間に覗く陽射しを信じて<br>
        心配事なんて 全部取り除くから<br>
        これでもう大丈夫<br>
        遠い朝でも(Baby don't cry)<br>
        愛をなくしても(Baby don't cry)<br>
        一人になんてしないから(Baby don't cry)<br>
        Baby don't cry<br>
        Always stay by your side<br>
        <br>
        Baby もうDon't cry (Baby don't cry yeah)<br>
        It's gon' be alright (It's gon' be alright)<br>
        Baby もうDon't cry (Baby もうDon't cry)<br>
        You'll see the sunshine (See the sunshine)<br>
        Baby もうどのくらい(Baby don't baby don't cry)<br>
        一人でyou've been tryin'(一人でyou've been tryin')<br>
        Baby もうDon't cry (Baby もうDon't cry)<br>
        You'll see the sunshine (You'll see the sunshine)<br>

        Can you remember that?<br>
        I remember<br>
        <br>
        Waiting at the light, I see a blue t-shirt I remember (I remember that)<br>
        It's been three years, but his smile hasn't changed (Time goes by)<br>
        I'm about to call out, but there's someone I don't know next to him,<br>
        The sky, reflected in my suddenly-averted eyes, is the same as always.<br>
        <br>
        I'm sure this is the way that people, little by little,<br>
        Hide away their memories of seasons past,<br>
        Someday I'll gather the tears I've spilled<br>
        And bask them in the sun until they sparkle.<br>
        <br>
        ※So, baby, don't be sad,<br>
        There are things you can't understand even if you think about them,<br>
        Even on the hardest roads, if you keep going forward,<br>
        There is hope.<br>
        So even on rainy mornings (baby don't cry),<br>
        Even if love looks like it'll disappear (baby don't cry),<br>
        I won't leave you alone (baby don't cry),<br>
        Baby, don't cry,<br>
        I'll always stay by your side.※<br>
        <br>
        There are so many sleepless nights where you just toss and turn,<br>
        You feel forlorn, you heave a great sigh (yeah I know),<br>
        When worries come to you, and you can't quell them,<br>
        Hold someone's hand, and give it your best as you go towards an unknown tomorrow.<br>
        <br>
        Everyone has the strength<br>
        To face darkness as many times as necessary,<br>
        No one is going to choose for you,<br>
        Take that first step.<br>
        <br>
        ※Repeat<br>
        <br>
        There are days (when I lose myself),<br>
        When the person in the mirror seems like a stranger (when I need someone's help),<br>
        But don't give up, let me see your smile,<br>
        Hey, why don't you take the good road?<br>
        The day will come when you can talk and laugh again (don't cry, cry...)<br>
        <br>
        Come on, baby, hold out your hands,<br>
        Believe in the sunlight peeping through the clouds,<br>
        I'll take away all your worries, so<br>
        Look, you'll be all right.<br>
        Even if the morning is far off (baby don't cry),<br>
        Even if you lose your love (baby don't cry),<br>
        I won't ever leave you alone (baby don't cry),<br>
        Baby don't cry<br>
        I'll always stay by your side.<br>
        <br>
        Baby, don't cry anymore (baby don't cry yeah)<br>
        It's gon' be alright (It's gon' be alright)<br>
        Baby, don't cry anymore (baby don't cry anymore)<br>
        You'll see the sunshine (see the sunshine)<br>
        Baby, how hard (baby don't baby don't cry)<br>
        Have you been tryin' on your own? (You've been tryin' on your own)<br>
        Baby don't cry anymore (baby don't cry anymore)<br>
        You'll see the sunshine (you'll see the sunshine).<br>
