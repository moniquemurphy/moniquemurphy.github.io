        あのコーナーを静かに<br>
        曲がって暗いうちに<br>
        家に戻ろうかなと<br>
        思ったころ いい感じに<br>
        なってきたからもうちっょと<br>
        このままそのまま<br>
        車の助手席あんたと二人きり<br>
        やさしい揺れに<br>
        目を閉じてしまうの<br>
        窓を開け すきま風<br>
        感じて帰りたくなくなった<br>
        そろそろずっと<br>
        <br>
        I think allday and allways pray<br>
        It's hard to say bit It's the only way<br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        so please stay w/z me<br>
        allnight and tell me<br>
        What you needs is me<br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        So please stay w/z me<br>
        allnight and tell me<br>
        What you needs is me<br>
        <br>
        橋のWay そろそろ夜だね<br>
        灯台のてっぺん<br>
        登って天使がヘリコプターで<br>
        移動して行く<br>
        何か変だねやっぱり<br>
        帰りたくない つらい<br>
        あなたの動き1つ1つ<br>
        記憶に残したい<br>
        <br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        So please stay w/z me<br>
        allnight and tell me<br>
        What you needs is me<br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        So please stay w/z me<br>
        allnight and tell me<br>
        What you needs is me<br>

        When we turned that corner<br>
        Quietly, in the dark,<br>
        I thought, maybe I should be<br>
        Getting home, but the mood is right,<br>
        So I'll just stay a little longer,<br>
        At this rate, at that rate,<br>
        In the passenger seat as you drive,<br>
        Swaying gently,<br>
        I close my eyes,<br>
        I open the window and feel the breeze,<br>
        I don't want to go home anymore,<br>
        Soon I never will.<br>
        <br>
        I think allday and allways pray<br>
        It's hard to say bit It's the only way<br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        so please stay w/z me<br>
        allnight and tell me<br>
        What you needs is me<br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        So please stay w/z me<br>
        allnight and tell me<br>
        What you needs is me<br>
        <br>
        On the bridge, night is falling,<br>
        We climb to the top<br>
        Of the lighthouse, the helicopters are angels,<br>
        Moving int he air,<br>
        Something is strange, after all,<br>
        I don't want to go home, it's too painful,<br>
        I want to imprint every single one of your movements<br>
        On my memory.<br>
        <br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        So please stay w/z me<br>
        allnight and tell me<br>
        What you needs is me<br>
        I'll make you feel alnight<br>
        So please stay w/z me<br>
