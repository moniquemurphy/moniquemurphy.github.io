        なんだか胸騒ぎな午前一時<br>
        やけに静かで冴えわたる意識<br>
        捲るページじゃ解けない七不思議<br>
        秒針がチクタクチクタクI can't sleep<br>
        <br>
        思い立ったらすぐJump into my car<br>
        月の中までmmm ah... Not too far<br>
        カーステ揺らすSpecialなBeat is wild 'n' phat<br>
        合図はKick Clap Kick Clap Let's start<br>
        <br>
        I lose controlだって今夜はそうFull Moon<br>
        甘い香り満ちあふれるMidnight cruise<br>
        こんな感じまるでBefore the typhoon<br>
        曖昧な態度なんてできないThat's rule<br>
        Somebody needs somebody<br>
        Somebody wants somebody<br>

        <div class="lyrics_title">FULL MOON</div>
        It's 1 a.m., my heart's astir,<br>
        It's awfully quiet, my consciousness is sharp,<br>
        As long as I keep turning the pages, the wonders never cease,<br>
        The second hand goes tick, tock, tick, tock, I can't sleep.<br>
        <br>
        When the thought comes to mind, I jump into my car,<br>
        I'm off to the middle of the moon, mmm, ah...not too far,<br>
        The beat coming over the stereo is wild 'n' phat,<br>
        The signal is kick, clap, kick, clap, let's start.<br>
        <br>
        I lose control, I can't help it, it's a full moon,<br>
        This is a midnight cruise full of sweet scents,<br>
        It feels just like it does before a typhoon,<br>
        I can't act with a vague attitude, that's the rule,<br>
        Somebody needs somebody,<br>
        Somebody wants somebody,<br>
        Everybody talks to somebody,<br>
        That's the kind of party, party, party under the moon that it is,<br>
        Under the full moon.<br>
        <br>
        You can hear a wolf man's howl here and there,<br>
        A white rabbit blushes,<br>
        I've memorized the manual on how to conceal one's true identity,<br>
        Excuse me, Miss, Mr., Mrs. Masquerade.<br>
        <br>
        There's a time limit, the kind you see in fairy tales,<br>
        You're only three millimeters from touching my heart,<br>
        The next is all on you, come on, is this reality or a dream?<br>
        The end is love, hate, life, pain, everything.<br>
        <br>
        I lose control, I can't help it, it's a full moon,<br>
        This is a midnight cruise full of sweet scents,<br>
        It feels just like it does before a typhoon,<br>
        I can't act with a vague attitude, that's the rule,<br>
        Somebody needs somebody,<br>
        Somebody wants somebody,<br>
        Everybody talks to somebody,<br>
        That's the kind of party, party, party under the moon that it is,<br>
        Under the full moon.<br>
        <br>
        I lose control, I can't help it, it's a full moon,<br>
        This is a midnight cruise full of sweet scents,<br>
        It feels just like it does before a typhoon,<br>
        I can't act with a vague attitude, that's the rule,<br>
        Somebody needs somebody,<br>
        Somebody wants somebody,<br>
        Everybody talks to somebody,<br>
        That's the kind of party, party, party under the moon that it is,<br>
        Under the full moon.<br>
