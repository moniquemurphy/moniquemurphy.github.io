        見えないものばかり<br>
        信じては引き裂かれ<br>
        見失う光のかたち<br>
        <br>
        明日はどうせ無条件<br>
        来るから<br>
        疾走るしかない<br>

        If you believe in things you can't see<br>
        They'll fall apart,<br>
        Like a light that fades.<br>
        <br>
        Tomorrow will come<br>
        No matter what,<br>
        So all you can do is sprint towards it.<br>
        <br>
        ※and baby that's as good as it gets<br>

        <br>
        If you trust your heart<br>
        To the speed of light<br>
        You'll be able to hear unhearable sounds.<br>
        <br>
        Dreams are born from dreams<br>
        That's where<br>
        It all begins.<br>

        Run faster,<br>
        Someday you'll get higher...whoa...<br>
        Everyone's a dreamer,<br>
        Discovering their dreams,<br>
        Baby take it all the way and never stop.<br>
