        Everybody's spent a night feeling like a stranger<br>
        傷を癒す術すらwe don't know<br>
        Everybody wants to know how to be stronger<br>
        なのに涙さえwe can't control<br>
        <br>
        But it's true どんな時も<br>
        Just the way you are<br>
        We can make it through<br>
        誰もがそう 輝けるlike a star<br>
        <br>
        In my heart 静かに<br>
        In your heart 溢れる<br>
        この笑顔できっと we can change the world<br>
        その笑顔でもっと you can heal the world<br>
        You're beautiful<br>
        <br>
        Don't have to be strong そのままで<br>
        Being right or being wrong 構わない<br>
        何一つ出来ないような日もあって<br>
        It's no surprise<br>
        <br>
        It's trueこの胸は<br>
        Aching all the time<br>
        But let's move on<br>
        一歩ずつ 踏み出していこうyou and I<br>
        <br>
        In my heart 静かに<br>
        In your heart 溢れる<br>
        この笑顔できっと we can change the world<br>
        その笑顔でもっと you can heal the world<br>
        You're beautiful<br>
        <br>
        そう答えはいつも<br>
        Blowing in the wind<br>
        探し続けようrain or shine<br>
        変わる事のない愛<br>
        <br>
        In my heart 静かに<br>
        In your heart 溢れる<br>
        この笑顔できっと we can change the world<br>
        その笑顔でもっと you can heal the world<br>
        You're beautiful<br>
