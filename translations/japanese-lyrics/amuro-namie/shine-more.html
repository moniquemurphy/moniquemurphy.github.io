        check it out…<br>
        music come on, you were gone<br>
        無言と不安の<br>
        理由とリアルを知ってる both of us<br>
        鼓動のリズムはずっと<br>
        生きてる… tellin' you why<br>
        会いたい I can't tonight<br>
        moon is so bright<br>
        <br>
        many seasons, many scenes<br>
        でも close my eyes<br>
        この愛は<br>
        永遠に to you<br>
        <br>
        baby remember to shine<br>
        遠い日の your mind<br>
        通り雨じゃない<br>
        尊い many nights<br>
        baby remember to shine<br>
        こんなに every time<br>
        un- でも追わない<br>
        believe that you're my baby<br>
        aa…I wanna shine<br>
        <br>
        music come on　あの記憶<br>
        聴いてたアナログ<br>
        フレーズ繰り返す　&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;頭の奥<br>
        夜明けのように let go<br>
        明日へ Why should I cry<br>
        あんなに泣いたのは最初で最後<br>
        <br>
        many reasons, many things<br>
        今 close my eyes<br>
        この愛は…oh<br>
        many seasons, many scenes<br>
        ねぇ close your eyes<br>
        あの愛は…oh<br>
        <br>
        baby remember to shine<br>
        消えない knowing pain<br>
        昨日の morning rain<br>
        綺麗な思い出<br>
        baby remember to shine<br>
        こんなに every time<br>
        un- でも追わない<br>

        everybody's here, everybody hears<br>
        and nobody can't stop music<br>

        check it out...<br>
        The music comes on, but you're gone,<br>
        The both of us know the reasons and reality<br>
        Of the silence and anxiety.<br>
        The rhythm of our heartbeats<br>
        Is always alive...I'm tellin' you why,<br>
        I want to see you, I can't tonight,<br>
        The moon is so bright.<br>
        <br>
        Many seasons, many scenes,<br>
        But when I close my eyes,<br>
        This love for you<br>
        Is eternal.<br>
        <br>
        Baby, remember to shine,<br>
        Your mind, on a distant day<br>
        Is not a rain shower,<br>
        All those precious nights,<br>
        Baby, remember to shine,<br>
        Every time, I...<br>
        But I won't follow you,<br>
        Believe that you're my baby,<br>
        Ah, I wanna shine.<br>
        <br>
        Music, come on, I heard<br>
        That memory in analog,<br>
        The phrase repeats in the back of my mind,<br>
        Let it go, like the dawn,<br>
        Why should I cry tomorrow?<br>
        That's the first and last time I'll ever cry that hard.<br>
        <br>
        Many reasons, many things,<br>
        Now I close my eyes,<br>
        This love is...oh<br>
        Many seasons, many scenes,<br>
        Hey, close your eyes,<br>
        That love was...oh<br>
        <br>
        Baby, remember to shine,<br>
        This pain I know won't disappear,<br>
        Yesterday's morning rain,<br>
        Beautiful memories,<br>
        Baby, remember to shine,<br>
        Every time, I...<br>
        But I won't follow you,<br>
        Believe that you're my baby.<br>
        <br>
        Everybody's here, everybody hears<br>
        And nobody can stop the music,<br>
        You're gone forever,<br>
        Everybody's here, everybody hears<br>
        And nobody can stop the music,<br>
        You're gone forever,<br>
        Forever.<br>
        <br>
        Baby, remember to shine,<br>
        Your mind, on a distant day<br>
        Is not a rain shower,<br>
        All those precious nights.<br>
        <br>
        Baby, remember to shine,<br>
        This pain I know won't disappear,<br>

        I wanna shine, yeah, yeah.<br>
        <br>
        Baby, remember to shine<br>
        I won't forget you,<br>
