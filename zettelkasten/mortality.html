<p>What <i>The Good Place</i> got wrong is that a self-imposed version of mortality in The Good Place would not be enough, I don't think. If one had all the time in the world to do whatever one wanted, one may never do anything, because there would always be time to do it in the future. The fact that your children will grow up and it's possible to miss it motivates you to spend time with them. The fact that you <a href="/surrender/">cannot possibly do everything you want in life</a> means you must choose and do <i>something</i> or end up with nothing. It's honestly beautiful even though it is frustrating. Death sharpens the edges of our lives.</p>
