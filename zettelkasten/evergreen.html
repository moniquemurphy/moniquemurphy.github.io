title: "Evergreen Notes (concept)"

<p>What do I even think about this concept? I do like that it's like you set a "Hmm, think about this periodically" kind of thing. I love to just stumble upon things and reread things and get reminders. That's what I love about SuperMemo. This reminds me of that book about writing during grad school, actually, writing advice I've heard often: <a href="rewriting.html">The hard work of writing is rewriting</a>.</p>
