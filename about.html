<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  This is a random site of stuff that I want to house on the internet. I hope you find something that strikes your fancy.
</p>

<p>The domain name comes from my IRL nickname: Momo, and my home station when I studied abroad in Japan: Oomori-eki.</p>

<p>I wish I'd kept track of all the manga I've fan translated in my almost 20 years of translating for fun and professionally. Some that I can remember are <i>Kiss and Never Cry</i>,<i>Lady Marmalade</i>, <i>Yokujou Climax</i>, and some of <i>Skip Beat</i>, <i>Parfait Tic!</i>. If you've enjoyed anything I've ever translated, I want you to know how fulfilling it is to have been able to be part of connecting you to that work.</p>
